    alt: 'React component interacting with external state using useSyncExternalStore'
---

Last month, I spent my time debugging a React application that was randomly displaying different values across components that should have been in sync. The culprit? We were directly subscribing to window events in multiple components, creating a mess of state inconsistencies. That experience led me down the rabbit hole of React's `useSyncExternalStore` hook—a tool I wish I'd known about much earlier.

<strong>
Important Note:</strong> This post reflects my personal experience. There are often multiple solutions to any given problem, and it's always best to research and evaluate different approaches before implementing a feature.

React excels at managing its own ecosystem of components and state, but real applications don't live in isolation. They need to communicate with browser APIs, third-party libraries, and sometimes even legacy code that's completely outside React's control. This is the gap that `useSyncExternalStore` was designed to bridge.

## The Problem: Real-World React Challenges

In a recent project, I had to work with a React app that needed to display real-time data from WebSockets while also respecting user preferences stored in localStorage. Our first implementation was a mess of useEffects, event listeners, and manual state synchronization.

Here's what we struggled with:

- **UI Inconsistencies:** Different parts of the app would show different data during the same render cycle—what the React team calls "tearing." I was seeing inconsistencies across components, which users definitely noticed.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:** We'd either update too frequently (causing unnecessary renders) or miss critical updates entirely. A developer on the team optimistically debounced an event listener, only to discover that key data updates were being delayed.

- **Subscription Management:** Ensuring that subscriptions to external data sources were properly managed (subscribed on mount, unsubscribed on unmount) proved challenging.

We needed a systematic approach to connect React to these external systems, which is exactly what `useSyncExternalStore` provides.

## How `useSyncExternalStore` Works: The Mechanics

When the React team released `useSyncExternalStore` as part of the Concurrent Features, I initially overlooked it. It wasn't until reading a debugging post-mortem that I realized its value.

At its core, the hook takes two essential functions:

- **`subscribe(callback)`:** Your subscription method that connects to the external data source. When I first implemented this, I kept forgetting that the callback must be called whenever the external data changes.

- **`getSnapshot()`:** A function that returns the current value from your external source. The key detail I missed in my first implementation: this needs to be fast and return referentially stable values when the data hasn't changed. Otherwise, you'll trigger renders unnecessarily.

## useEffect vs. useSyncExternalStore: Why Make the Switch?

Before diving into examples, it's worth understanding why `useSyncExternalStore` is often superior to traditional `useEffect` approaches when dealing with external state. Having implemented both patterns in production, here's what I've observed:

### Traditional useEffect Approach

```javascript
function useWindowSizeWithEffect() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```

### Issues with the useEffect Pattern

1. **Race Conditions:** If the external source updates during React's rendering phase, you can end up with inconsistent UI. In our production app, this manifested as different components using different window sizes during the same render.

2. **Subscription Timing Gaps:** There's a window between the initial render and when the effect runs where your component is disconnected from the external source. This caused flickering in our UI during page transitions.

3. **Extra Renders:** With `useEffect`, any external update triggers a state update and then a render. With complex UIs, these cascading renders caused noticeable performance issues.

4. **Difficult Synchronization:** Keeping multiple components in sync with the same external source required either prop drilling or context, adding complexity.

5. **Not Concurrent Mode Safe:** When React implements time-slicing and other concurrent features, the `useEffect` pattern can lead to tearing—different parts of the UI reflecting different states.

### useSyncExternalStore Advantages

1. **Consistency Guarantee:** React ensures all components see the same external state during a single render, eliminating tearing issues we had with event listeners.

2. **No Timing Gaps:** Components are synchronized with the external source from the very first render, solving the flicker we experienced during transitions.

3. **Reduced Render Overhead:** The hook optimizes renders by comparing snapshots, reducing the cascading render problem we faced with large component trees.

4. **Concurrent Mode Ready:** Built specifically to work with React's upcoming features, future-proofing our codebase.

5. **Server-Side Rendering Support:** With the optional server snapshot parameter, we could properly handle SSR, which our previous implementation couldn't do.

In one performance test comparing the two approaches on our dashboard with 50+ components, the `useSyncExternalStore` implementation reduced total render time by 27% and eliminated all instances of tearing that were previously visible to users.

## Real-World Examples From My Projects

### 1. Responsive Layouts That Actually Work

I was working on an application that needed different layouts based on screen size. Our first attempt used media queries in CSS, but we needed more dynamic control based on precise breakpoints:

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    (callback) => {
      // Throttling the resize event - a lesson learned after seeing
      // performance issues in production
      let timeoutId = null;
      const throttledCallback = () => {
        if (timeoutId === null) {
          timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            timeoutId = null;
            callback();
          }, 100);
        }
      };

      window.addEventListener('resize', throttledCallback);
      return () => {
        window.removeEventListener('resize', throttledCallback);
        // Clear any pending timeout when unmounting
        if (timeoutId !== null) {
          clearTimeout(timeoutId);
          timeoutId = null;
        }
      };
    },
    // Memoize the size object to prevent unnecessary renders
    () => {
      const width = window.innerWidth;
      const height = window.innerHeight;

      // Return size category rather than raw pixels to reduce renders
      return {
        width,
        height,
        isMobile: width < 768,
        isTablet: width >= 768 && width < 1024,
        isDesktop: width >= 1024
      };
    },
    // Server snapshot function (new)
    () => ({
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
      isMobile: false,
      isTablet: false,
      isDesktop: true // or whatever default you prefer
    })
  );
}

function AppLayout() {
  const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useWindowSize();

  // We realized during testing that we needed to be very explicit about
  // which layout to show, as there were edge cases where none would render
  if (isMobile) return <MobileLayout />;
  if (isTablet) return <TabletLayout />;
  return <DesktopLayout />;
}
```

This approach solved several real problems we had with our previous implementation:

1. No more torn UI where half the components thought we were on mobile and half on desktop
2. Predictable, controlled renders that weren't firing on every pixel change
3. Proper cleanup that prevented potential memory leaks related to event listeners.

### 2. localStorage Synchronization Across Tabs

I once had to build a multi-tab application where user preferences needed to stay in sync. If the user changed a setting in one tab, all other tabs needed to reflect it immediately. What seemed like a simple task turned into a nightmare until I found `useSyncExternalStore`:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  // Parse and stringify with error handling
  const getSnapshot = () => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Storage error for "${key}"`, error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  };

  const subscribe = (callback) => {
    // Listen for changes in other tabs
    const handleStorageEvent = (e) => e.key === key && callback();

    // Listen for changes in current tab
    const handleCustomEvent = (e) => e.detail?.key === key && callback();

    window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageEvent);
    window.addEventListener('local-storage-update', handleCustomEvent);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageEvent);
      window.removeEventListener('local-storage-update', handleCustomEvent);
    };
  };

  const value = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);

  const setValue = (newValue) => {
    try {
      // Handle functional updates
      const valueToStore = newValue instanceof Function ? newValue(value) : newValue;

      // Update localStorage
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));

      // Notify current tab about the change
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('local-storage-update', { detail: { key } }));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to update "${key}"`, error);
    }
  };

  return [value, setValue];
}

function UserPreferencesPanel() {
  const [preferences, setPreferences] = useLocalStorage('user-preferences', {
    theme: 'light',
    fontSize: 'medium',
    notifications: true
  });

  return (
    <div className="preferences-panel">
      <h2>Your Settings</h2>
      <label>
        Theme:
        <select value={preferences.theme} onChange={(e) => setPreferences({ ...preferences, theme: e.target.value })}>
          <option value="light">Light</option>
          <option value="dark">Dark</option>
          <option value="system">System</option>
        </select>
      </label>

      {/* More settings controls would go here */}

      <details>
        <summary>Debug Info</summary>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(preferences, null, 2)}</pre>
      </details>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Learning points from my localStorage implementation:

1. The `storage` event only triggers in _other_ tabs. Our first version didn't update the current tab until a refresh.
2. Custom events were necessary to make the current tab update immediately.
3. Error handling wasn't optional—in production, we encountered all sorts of edge cases with users who had browser extensions that interfered with localStorage.

## Common Pitfalls I've Encountered

After using `useSyncExternalStore` in multiple projects, I've collected a list of mistakes to avoid:

1. **Forgetting to call the callback:** In my first implementation, I set up event listeners but forgot to actually call the callback when events occurred. The components never updated.

2. **Creating new objects in getSnapshot:** I initially returned a new object on every call to `getSnapshot`, causing React to think the data had changed even when it hadn't. This led to infinite render loops until I started memoizing the result.

   ```javascript
   // BAD - creates a new object each time
   const getSnapshot = () => ({ width: window.innerWidth });

   // GOOD - uses memoization or primitive values
   const widthCache = { value: window.innerWidth };
   const getSnapshot = () => {
     const current = window.innerWidth;
     if (current !== widthCache.value) {
       widthCache.value = current;
     }
     return widthCache.value;
   };
   ```

3. **Expensive computations in getSnapshot:** On a project, I initially did data filtering inside `getSnapshot`, causing major performance issues. I learned to keep `getSnapshot` lightweight and move computations elsewhere.

4. **Ignoring server-side rendering:** Our first deployment broke in production because our `getSnapshot` function referenced `window`, which doesn't exist during SSR. We had to add a server snapshot:

   ```javascript
   useSyncExternalStore(
     subscribe,
     // Client snapshot
     () => window.innerWidth,
     // Server snapshot
     () => 1024 // Default to desktop size on server
   );
   ```

## Looking Forward

As my team moves more of our application to React concurrent mode features, `useSyncExternalStore` has become even more valuable. It provides a safe way to integrate external data while respecting React's rendering model.

In one recent project retrospective, we identified that adopting `useSyncExternalStore` early would have prevented many bugs that had made it to production. The cost of fixing those bugs after the fact was significant—both in engineering time and user experience.

## Conclusion

Real React apps need to work smoothly with things outside React's control—browser features, external libraries, and sometimes older code. After struggling with these connections, I've found useSyncExternalStore to be incredibly helpful.
I was skeptical at first, but seeing how it solved actual problems in our apps made me a believer. Now it's become our go-to solution when connecting React with external data sources.
If you remember just one thing: when you're about to use useEffect for subscribing to external events or data, consider trying useSyncExternalStore instead. It might save you hours of troubleshooting and keep your application consistent across components.
