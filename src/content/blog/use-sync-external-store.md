    alt: 'React component interacting with external state using useSyncExternalStore'
---

Last month, I spent three days debugging a React application that was randomly displaying different values across components that should have been in sync. The culprit? We were directly subscribing to window events in multiple components, creating a mess of state inconsistencies. That painful experience led me down the rabbit hole of React's `useSyncExternalStore` hook—a tool I wish I'd known about much earlier.

React excels at managing its own ecosystem of components and state, but real applications don't live in isolation. They need to communicate with browser APIs, third-party libraries, and sometimes even legacy code that's completely outside React's control. This is the gap that `useSyncExternalStore` was designed to bridge.

## The Problem: Real-World React Challenges

In a recent project, I had to work with a React app that needed to display real-time data from WebSockets while also respecting user preferences stored in localStorage. Our first implementation was a mess of useEffects, event listeners, and manual state synchronization.

Here's what we struggled with:

- **UI Inconsistencies:** Different parts of the app would show different data during the same render cycle—what the React team calls "tearing." I was seeing inconsistencies across components, which users definitely noticed.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:** We'd either update too frequently (causing unnecessary renders) or miss critical updates entirely. A developer on the team optimistically debounced an event listener, only to discover that key data updates were being delayed.

- **Memory Leaks:** During a performance audit, we discovered dozens of abandoned event listeners after component unmounts. In one instance, a tab left open overnight crashed browsers because a resize handler kept accumulating.

We needed a systematic approach to connect React to these external systems, which is exactly what `useSyncExternalStore` provides.

## How `useSyncExternalStore` Works: The Mechanics

When the React team released `useSyncExternalStore` as part of the Concurrent Features, I initially overlooked it. It wasn't until reading a debugging post-mortem that I realized its value.

At its core, the hook takes two essential functions:

- **`subscribe(callback)`:** Your subscription method that connects to the external data source. When I first implemented this, I kept forgetting that the callback must be called whenever the external data changes.

- **`getSnapshot()`:** A function that returns the current value from your external source. The key detail I missed in my first implementation: this needs to be fast and return referentially stable values when the data hasn't changed. Otherwise, you'll trigger renders unnecessarily.

## Real-World Examples From My Projects

### 1. Responsive Layouts That Actually Work

I was working on an application that needed different layouts based on screen size. Our first attempt used media queries in CSS, but we needed more dynamic control based on precise breakpoints:

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    (callback) => {
      // Throttling the resize event - a lesson learned after seeing
      // performance issues in production
      let timeoutId = null;
      const throttledCallback = () => {
        if (timeoutId === null) {
          timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            timeoutId = null;
            callback();
          }, 100);
        }
      };

      window.addEventListener('resize', throttledCallback);
      return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', throttledCallback);
    },
    // Memoize the size object to prevent unnecessary renders
    () => {
      const width = window.innerWidth;
      const height = window.innerHeight;

      // Return size category rather than raw pixels to reduce renders
      return {
        width,
        height,
        isMobile: width < 768,
        isTablet: width >= 768 && width < 1024,
        isDesktop: width >= 1024
      };
    }
  );
}

function AppLayout() {
  const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useWindowSize();

  // We realized during testing that we needed to be very explicit about
  // which layout to show, as there were edge cases where none would render
  if (isMobile) return <MobileLayout />;
  if (isTablet) return <TabletLayout />;
  return <DesktopLayout />;
}
```

This approach solved several real problems we had with our previous implementation:

1. No more torn UI where half the components thought we were on mobile and half on desktop
2. Predictable, controlled renders that weren't firing on every pixel change
3. Proper cleanup that prevented the memory leaks we'd experienced

### 2. localStorage Synchronization Across Tabs

I once had to build a multi-tab application where user preferences needed to stay in sync. If the user changed a setting in one tab, all other tabs needed to reflect it immediately. What seemed like a simple task turned into a nightmare until I found `useSyncExternalStore`:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  // This serialization/deserialization helper prevented the JSON bugs
  // we kept hitting with complex data structures
  const serialize = (value) => {
    try {
      return JSON.stringify(value);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to serialize value for key "${key}"`, error);
      return JSON.stringify(initialValue);
    }
  };

  const deserialize = (storedValue) => {
    try {
      return storedValue ? JSON.parse(storedValue) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to parse stored value for key "${key}"`, error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  };

  const getSnapshot = () => {
    return deserialize(window.localStorage.getItem(key));
  };

  const subscribe = (callback) => {
    // The storage event only fires in OTHER tabs/windows
    const handleStorageChange = (e) => {
      if (e.key === key) {
        callback();
      }
    };

    // For updates in the CURRENT tab, we need this custom event
    const handleCustomEvent = (e) => {
      if (e.detail?.key === key) {
        callback();
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
    window.addEventListener('local-storage-change', handleCustomEvent);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
      window.removeEventListener('local-storage-change', handleCustomEvent);
    };
  };

  const value = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);

  const setValue = (newValue) => {
    try {
      // Support functional updates
      const valueToStore = newValue instanceof Function ? newValue(value) : newValue;

      // Save to localStorage
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, serialize(valueToStore));

      // Notify current tab - the part I kept missing in early versions
      window.dispatchEvent(
        new CustomEvent('local-storage-change', {
          detail: { key, newValue: valueToStore }
        })
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to set localStorage value for key "${key}"`, error);
    }
  };

  return [value, setValue];
}

function UserPreferencesPanel() {
  const [preferences, setPreferences] = useLocalStorage('user-preferences', {
    theme: 'light',
    fontSize: 'medium',
    notifications: true
  });

  // Our support team thank me for this simple debugging feature
  const debugInfo = JSON.stringify(preferences, null, 2);

  return (
    <div className="preferences-panel">
      <h2>Your Settings</h2>

      <label>
        Theme:
        <select value={preferences.theme} onChange={(e) => setPreferences({ ...preferences, theme: e.target.value })}>
          <option value="light">Light</option>
          <option value="dark">Dark</option>
          <option value="system">System</option>
        </select>
      </label>

      {/* More preference controls... */}

      {/* This debug panel saved us countless hours of troubleshooting */}
      <details className="debug-panel">
        <summary>Debug Info</summary>
        <pre>{debugInfo}</pre>
      </details>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Learning points from my localStorage implementation:

1. The `storage` event only triggers in _other_ tabs. Our first version didn't update the current tab until a refresh.
2. Custom events were necessary to make the current tab update immediately.
3. Error handling wasn't optional—in production, we encountered all sorts of edge cases with users who had browser extensions that interfered with localStorage.

## Common Pitfalls I've Encountered

After using `useSyncExternalStore` in multiple projects, I've collected a list of mistakes to avoid:

1. **Forgetting to call the callback:** In my first implementation, I set up event listeners but forgot to actually call the callback when events occurred. The components never updated.

2. **Creating new objects in getSnapshot:** I initially returned a new object on every call to `getSnapshot`, causing React to think the data had changed even when it hadn't. This led to infinite render loops until I started memoizing the result.

   ```javascript
   // BAD - creates a new object each time
   const getSnapshot = () => ({ width: window.innerWidth });

   // GOOD - uses memoization or primitive values
   const widthCache = { value: window.innerWidth };
   const getSnapshot = () => {
     const current = window.innerWidth;
     if (current !== widthCache.value) {
       widthCache.value = current;
     }
     return widthCache.value;
   };
   ```

3. **Expensive computations in getSnapshot:** On a project, I initially did data filtering inside `getSnapshot`, causing major performance issues. I learned to keep `getSnapshot` lightweight and move computations elsewhere.

4. **Ignoring server-side rendering:** Our first deployment broke in production because our `getSnapshot` function referenced `window`, which doesn't exist during SSR. We had to add a server snapshot:

   ```javascript
   useSyncExternalStore(
     subscribe,
     // Client snapshot
     () => window.innerWidth,
     // Server snapshot
     () => 1024 // Default to desktop size on server
   );
   ```

## Looking Forward

As my team moves more of our application to React concurrent mode features, `useSyncExternalStore` has become even more valuable. It provides a safe way to integrate external data while respecting React's rendering model.

In one recent project retrospective, we identified that adopting `useSyncExternalStore` early would have prevented many bugs that had made it to production. The cost of fixing those bugs after the fact was significant—both in engineering time and user experience.

## Conclusion

Building real-world React applications means dealing with the messy reality of integrating with things outside React's control. Whether it's browser APIs, third-party libraries, or legacy code, `useSyncExternalStore` offers a clean, predictable way to bridge these worlds.

I've gone from skeptic to evangelist after seeing how this hook solved concrete problems in our production applications. It's now a standard part of our toolkit whenever we need to sync React with external state.

If you take one thing from this article, let it be this: whenever you find yourself reaching for `useEffect` to subscribe to external events or data sources, consider whether `useSyncExternalStore` might be a better fit. It might save you the debugging sessions that I had to endure!
