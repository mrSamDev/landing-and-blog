Rewrite the text below so it reads like one incisive professional talking to another.

- Keep every idea and fact unless changing it makes the point clearer.
- Active voice. Paragraphs no longer than three short sentences.
- Vary sentence length; avoid a metronome rhythm.
- Swap jargon or $10 words for plain ones. Use contractions.
- Delete clich√©s, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors (navigate, journey, roadmap, etc.).
- No bullet points unless they're essential for scan-ability.
- No summary footer. End on a crisp final line, not a recap.
- Never use em dashes; use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead.
- Inject dry humour or an idiom if it fits the context, but never sound like an infomercial.
- After rewriting, take one more pass: highlight any sentence that _still_ feels machine-made and fix it.
  Return only the rewritten text.
