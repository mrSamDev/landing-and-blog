## Core Components

1. Game Configuration

   - Canvas dimensions
   - Base paddle speed and ball speed settings
   - Power-up configurations
   - Color schemes and visual settings

2. Game State Management

   - Ball position and velocity
   - Paddle position and dimensions
   - Score tracking
   - Particle system state
   - Power-up management
   - Game status (paused/game over)

3. Game Mechanics

   - Ball movement and collision detection
   - Paddle control system
   - Score system
   - Power-up system with four types:
     - Wider paddle
     - Smaller paddle
     - Faster ball
     - Slower ball

4. Visual Effects
   - Particle system for:
     - Wall collisions
     - Ceiling collisions
     - Paddle collisions
     - Game over state
     - Power-up collection

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### State Management

- Uses React's useRef for game state to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implements TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Manages multiple state variables including:
  - Ball properties (position, speed, size)
  - Paddle properties (position, width)
  - Game status (score, pause state, game over)

### Game Loop

- Implements requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Handles:
  - Game element updates
  - Collision detection
  - Particle system updates
  - Power-up spawning and collection
  - Score tracking

### Particle System

- Creates dynamic particle effects for different game events
- Manages particle life cycles
- Implements color-coded effects for different events
- Uses mathematical calculations for particle dispersion

### Power-Up System

- 20% spawn chance on paddle hits
- Four distinct power-up types
- 5-second duration for effects
- Automatic reset to default values

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Issues

1. Particle system optimization needed

### In-progress

1. Leaderboard
2. Authentication using github

### Planned Improvements

1. Frame rate-independent movement implementation
2. Enhanced collision detection system
3. Optimized particle pool system
4. Web Audio API integration for sound effects
5. Mobile responsiveness improvements

## Technical Dependencies

- React
- TypeScript
- Canvas API
- React Hooks (useRef, useCallback)

## Development Focus Areas
