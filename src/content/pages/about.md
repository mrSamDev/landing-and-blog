![Profile image showing Sijo at work](/profile.jpg)

Hi, I'm Sijo from Ernakulam. I work with the team at Diagnal Technologies, where we build video streaming apps.

I started coding because I was curious how websites worked. My first job was at 7th Pillar Ventures, where I learned that making things work well is more important than making them look fancy. Now at Diagnal, I help my team build better video players and streaming apps.

When I'm not working, I dive into manga and anime. Here's what I keep watching again and again:

- Fairy Tail
- Katekyo Hitman Reborn!
- One Piece
- Solo Leveling
- And many many more

Reading:

- "I Was Mistaken as a Monstrous Genius Actor" - the plot twists keep coming
- "The Regressed Mercenary's Machinations" - chapter 175 and counting

These days, I'm learning about building faster websites and making apps that work well even with slow internet. If you want to chat about work, swap anime recommendations, or debate about the best arc in Solo Leveling, drop me a note.

Living in Ernakulam has its perks - decent internet for streaming anime, lots of good food spots, and a growing community of tech folks who share similar interests.

I try to write about what I learn at work and share it here. Not because I'm an expert, but because writing helps me think better. If any of this interests you, stick around.
