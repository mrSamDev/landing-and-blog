Lead at Gadgeon, running point for the SaaS Products team in Kochi. Since May 2025, I've led our jump to React 19. We moved a mountain of Angular code, rewrote 100,000+ lines, tied off loose ends, and yes, I'm still waiting for my wrist to recover. I run regular code reviews and knowledge-sharing sessions so everybodyâ€™s on the same page, not just playing keyboard roulette. I pushed for AI toolsâ€”Claude Code and Windsurfâ€”set real rules, got hands dirty with workshops. That nudged our developer output up by 10 percent, which is the only reason people forgive me for my table-flip moments.

Before Gadgeon, I led the frontend squad at Diagnal Technologies in London. I flushed out legacy React code, refactored for functional components, and we all watched app performance leapâ€”30 percent faster loading, 25 percent improvement overall. Guiding teams across continents brought interesting timezone math and a rapid bump to Front-End Lead. One-on-ones and code reviews curbed buggy commits and hiked productivity by a third. On the SEO front, I moved us to server-side rendering, wrangled meta tags, and got our apps climbing search rankings by 50 percent.

I started as a developer at 7th Pillar Ventures, mostly asking the question: why build bells and whistles if basic stuff barely works? That thinking stuck. I still believe no one cares how clever your solution is if it doesn't work well.

These days, you'll find me somewhere between debating anime plot twists and debugging CSS edge cases. Ernakulam isn't a bad place for thatâ€”solid internet for streaming, good food, and a handful of developers always up for coffee and complaining about state management.

On my blog, I jot down what I'm learning, not because I'm trying to show off, but because trying to explain something is usually the only way I understand it myself.

## Hereâ€™s What Fills My Days

I build SaaS platforms at Gadgeon. At Diagnal, I wrangled OTT apps and kept video players halfway sane on a mess of devices. I try to squeeze in Go tutorials when JS gives me too much dÃ©jÃ  vu. If I'm not slouched over a laptop, I might be jogging, although my running app wishes I'd lie less about my pace.

## Tech Stack and Other Fixations

```javascript
const Sijo = {
  frontend: ['React', 'JavaScript', 'CSS (minor dark art)'],
  current_obsession: 'Micro-interactions behaving the way I actually intend',
  past_adventures: ['Healthcare apps', 'Food delivery', 'Telecom solutions'],
  learning: "Go (just to keep life spicy)",
  workouts: ['Running', 'Trekking', 'Debug marathons']
};
```

## Some Facts They Donâ€™t Print on CVs

I care a ridiculous amount about animation staying smooth. Iâ€™ll get carried away over code structure or whether a manga arc flopped. If you want someone to overcomplicate a problem, Iâ€™m your person. Apparently, my explanations helpâ€”itâ€™s not just me saying so.

## Manga & Anime: The Real Priorities

Favorites? The list's long, but squeeze in Fairy Tail, One Piece, Solo Leveling, Bleach, Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Haikyu, and a rotating door of others. Latest binge: "I Was Mistaken as a Monstrous Genius Actor"â€”hasn't run out of twists yet. "The Regressed Mercenary's Machinations" is still going strong; Iâ€™m somewhere around chapter 175.

If you want to trade anime picks or drop a tip for debugging, Iâ€™m all ears. Assuming you catch me between browser restarts.
