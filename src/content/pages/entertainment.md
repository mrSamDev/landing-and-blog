## My Entertainment Journey

My adventure into global entertainment has been a beautiful evolution over the years. It all began when I was 14, discovering the magical world of anime at a time when it wasn't exactly the popular choice in India. While my peers were into different things, I found myself drawn into these incredible stories. My first adventures into this world were through Fairy Tail and One Piece - just thinking about them still brings a smile to my face and makes my heart flutter with joy.

As I turned 18, I ventured into the world of manhwa, discovering a whole new dimension of storytelling. Each series added new flavors to my growing love for entertainment. By 25, I found myself exploring K-dramas, C-dramas, and Turkish series, while developing a deep appreciation for world cinema - from timeless classics like The Godfather to the rich storytelling of Malayalam and Tamil cinema.
